Seymour is an interactive web-based tool designed to:

- Analyze historical stock trends using Bollinger Bands.
- Predict future stock prices for the next month using a simple linear regression model.
- Visualize stock data and predictions in an intuitive interface.

This app is built using Streamlit for the frontend and integrates various data analysis libraries like pandas, yfinance, and scikit-learn for backend computations.
